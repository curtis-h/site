        <p>I'm a keen mountain biker, trying to fit a ride in where I can during the week and usually venturing to more exciting trails during the weekends. I enjoy coding in my spare time, regularly going to hackathons which are great fun and provide an opportunity to learn something new or build something cool. I also enjoy reading, gaming and going to meetups and even organise a group called Bristol Urban Games where we put on games for people to play around the city.</p>
